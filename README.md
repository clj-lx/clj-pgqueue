# clj-lx/clj-pgqueue

A Clojure library designed to use Postgres as a queue storage.
Inspired by https://layerci.com/blog/postgres-is-the-answer/

## Usage

	(require '[clj-pgqueue.queue :as q])
	(require '[clj-pgqueue.impl.pgqueue :as pgqueue])
	
	(def queue (q/start (pgqueue/new->PGQueue {:datasource datasource :channel "channel-name-here"}))
	
	(q/subscribe queue (fn [job] (println "process your job" job)
	
	(q/push queue "payload")
	(q/push queue "another payload")
	
## TODO
  - [] api to handle in parallel the notifications (q/subscribe queue fn {:parallel 3})
  - [] retry/backoff strategy
